## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
year <- c(2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016)
b <-c(2.895,2.881,2.866,2.849,2.825,2.806,2.811,2.83,2.851,2.697,2.706,2.715,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772)
population <- 1000000*b
df <- data.frame(year, population)
c <- df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y = population)) + geom_point()
c
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
